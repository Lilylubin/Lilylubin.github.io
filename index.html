<h2> Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. <h2>
<h3> Damn you Stormcloaks, Skyrim was fine until you came along.<em> Empire was nice and lazy, if they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and been halfway to Hammerfell </em> </h3>
<p id="highlight"> You there. You and me -- we shouldn't be here, It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.<br>“We’re all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.”<br>“Shut up back there”
<br>“And what’s wrong with <em> him, </em> huh?<br>“Watch your tongue. You’re speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King."<br>“Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You’re the leader of the rebellion. But if they’ve captured you….Oh gods where are they taking us?”<br>“I don’t know where we’re going, but Sovngarde awaits.”<p>
